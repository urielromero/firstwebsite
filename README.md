# firstwebsite

This is one of the first websites I created using HTML and CSS with a Udemy course to follow along. 

Here we see some of the main concepts of the named languages to structure and enhance a websites look. 

This is a static one page website and no database has been connected.

In future practices I will add more advance elements to a page such as: animations, a carousel and a database, among others.
